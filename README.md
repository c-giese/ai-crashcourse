# Welcome to the AI-Workshop by assono

This repository contains general documentation, code examples and project ideas for the open coding part.

## Agenda

### Day one

- Welcome and getting to know each other
- Get to know ollama
- Network basics (only a little bit of theory)
- Build your first terminal based chat app
- Extend the functionality
- Utilize Langfuse for prompt management (Optional)
- Incorporate OpenWebUI for a more sophisticated look

### Day two

- Open Coding Lab: Implement your own idea!
- Feedback round

## Tasks

### Ollama

_01_ollama.md_

First, we want to get to know ollama, how to use and chat with models and how to modify them. The details can be found in _01_ollama.md_

1. Download and install the ollama server
2. Run your first model
3. Run a second model
4. Create your own Model

### Python Backend

_02_venv.md_ + _03_requests.md_

In this step, we want to create a virtual environment and build a terminal based Chat-App

1. Create a virtual environment (venv)
2. Build a rudimentary backend that sends a message to the ollama server
3. Extend the functionality to have a more seamless experience
